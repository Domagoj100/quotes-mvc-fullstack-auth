## Quotes

This is a simple fullstack project that uses MVC architecture, CRUD operations with a sprinkle of authentication. 

**Tech used:**
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, MongoDB, Express.

My learning was focused on creating fullstack app with simple UI that allows viewing of single quote on homepage or all quotes in database on separate page and "hides" CRUD operations behind simple local authentication.
